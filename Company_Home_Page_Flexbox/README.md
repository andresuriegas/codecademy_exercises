# Company Home Page with Flexbox Project

For this project a number of requirements were given. The project itself is open so I could pick the style, layout and content. For this project I took inspiration from the times I brew beer with friends. Our brewery's name is The Blind Tiger Brewing Co. 

The layout itself is simple, one page, with a centered nav bar, four different sections and a centered footer. The website had to include at least the following: 

* A title and logo or splash image.
* A mission statement or brief description of the company.
* A list or set of images and titles representing the product or products of the company.
* A section describing some of the companyâ€™s employees or teammates.

# Codecademy Portfolio
In this repo, I will publish, maintain, version control and content track different projects and exercises from Codecademy. 

The repo consists of a few folders, each folder corresponding to a specific project from the "Front-end Engineer" path in Codecademy. Since I work on the projects on my own, I saw no need to create multiple branches. Thus, everything is organized in folders in the main branch.

Each project is listed in chronological order below.

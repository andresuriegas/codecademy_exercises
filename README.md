# Codecademy Portfolio
In this repo, I will publish, maintain, version control and content track different projects and exercises from Codecademy. 

The repo consists of a number of folders, each folder corresponding to a specific project from the "Front-end Engineer" path in Codecademy. Since I work on the projects on my own, I saw no need to create multiple branches. Thus, everything is organized in folders in the main branch.

Unfortunately, GitHub Pages can only use as a source the master branch, docs/folder on the master branch and the gh-pages branch. For now, I will create a duplicate of the files needed to display the latest project I worked on or I'm currently working on. This way, GitHub Pages can make a page with those files, and I don't have to create a repo for each project.
